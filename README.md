# TDD with Mock Objects: Design Principles and Emerging Properties

This is a fork of Luca Minudel's original repo. He was using it for a study of TDD and Design principles. I am using it as a repository for storing four exercises for people wishing to improve their skills with TDD and SOLID principles.

- If you just want to do the exercises, look at the starting code of the [TDD micro-exercises] (https://github.com/emilybache/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises) in C#, Java, Javascript and Python

- When you've had a go yourself, you could look at  [proposed solutions] (https://github.com/emilybache/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises.ProposedSolution) in C#, Java, Javascript

- For background reading about Luca's study, see the [paper] (https://github.com/emilybache/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/blob/master/Paper/mockobjects_emergingproperties.pdf?raw=true) and the [presentation] (https://github.com/emilybache/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/blob/master/Slides/TDD-SOLID.pdf?raw=true)
