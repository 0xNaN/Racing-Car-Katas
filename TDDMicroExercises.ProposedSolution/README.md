# TDD micro-exercises

## A possible solution

Here one of the possible solutions for the exercise, it contains only the changes required to make the classes testable.

In this solution some of the design principles violations has been removed as consequence of changes required to make the class testable, other violations are still there.

Can you spot these violations? Can you mention a change request or a new feature request that surface a violation? Can you suggest a refactoring that remove that violation?
